QSM-DD-DRC,"Streamflow data are estimated by transforming water level observations. A dynamic rating curve method is used (coefficients are updated twice a month using streamflow measurement data from up to three months ahead and three months before). Water level data are recorded every 15 minutes (water level loggers installed in a stilling well hydraulically connected to the stream), and streamflow is measured with a current meter twice a month (to calibrate the coefficients of the rating curve). The water levels are averaged in an hourly time step, the streamflow data are calculated at the same time step, then daily averages are computed. ",
GWL-DD-MN-AUT,Groundwater levels are measured by a water level meter twice a month and automatically recorded every 12 h by water level loggers. ,
PP-DD-IDW,The areal daily precipitation data were obtained by integrating the surfaces (grid 50 m x 50 m) generated from the spatial interpolation of point-measurements (rain gauges). The inverse distance weighting method (power=2) was used. ,
ET-DD-FAO56-HTS-IDW,Potential evapotranspiration was calculated following the Penman-Monteith Method - FAO56. The data from automatic weather stations were averaged in hourly time steps. Then cumulative daily evapotranspiration rates were calculated for each weather station and the results were spatially interpolated using the inverse distance weighting method (power=2). The daily evapotranspiration as an areal average of the watershed was calculated by integrating the generated surface (grid 50 m x 50 m).,
